Activity
========
This module does not implement any function but only a relational model that
can be inherited in different specific modules.

Adds the "Activity" model. An activity is whether a job or a leave type.
It is meant to be used in both timesheet and payroll modules but for different
reasons.
    - Timesheet: Used when one employee may have different jobs (or task) in
        the same company witch imply different cost prices. In his timesheet,
        he can enter the time he spent for every job or leave type.

    - Payroll: Used in worked days to identify if a worked days line is
        a normal worked day, a vacation day, a sick leave...

Adds the vacation leave type.

Adds the paid_leave boolean field on leave types (used on payslips)
