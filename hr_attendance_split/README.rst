Attendance Split Configuration:
#. Go to *Attendances -> Configuration*.
#. Choose Split Overnight Attendance if you want attendances that cross
overnight to be split into two attendances at midnight.

Usage
=====

#. Split overnight attendance (if enabled) is used if attendances shouldn't
cross overnight and will generate another attendance for the next day, split
at midnight of the timezone that is set on the employee record. A banner will
