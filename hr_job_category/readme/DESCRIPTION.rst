This module was written to extend the functionality of jobs
to support tagging employees based on their job positions.
For example, all Supervisors could be attached to the Supervisors category.
Define which categories a job belongs to in the configuration for the job.
When an employee is assigned a particular job the categories attached to that
job will be attached to the employee record as well.
