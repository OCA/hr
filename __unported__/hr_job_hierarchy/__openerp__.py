Define Hierarchy of Jobs
========================

    1. Define parent/child relationship for jobs, which is useful for
       determining supervisor/subordinate relationships.
    2. Provide a knob in Job configuration to specify if the person with that
       job should be considered the Department manager.
    3. Automatically set the manager of a department based on this knob in job
       configuration.
    4. Automatically set an employee's manager from the department's manager.
