Extended Capabilities for HR Holidays (Leaves)
==============================================

    * When calculating the number of leave days take into account the
      employee's schedule and public holidays
    * The 'Need Action' mechanism assumes the HR Manager approves leave
      requests
    * Rename 'Leave Requests' menu item to 'My Leaves'
      (which is closer to its intent)
    * Add a new menu item: All Leave Requests
    * New way of entering leaves based on the number of days requested, rather
      than by specifying a start and end date. You tell it how many days to
      grant and it calculates the start and end dates based on the employee's
      schedule.
    * Allow a manager to approve the leave requests of subordinates (manager
      must be immediate superior of employee or manager of employee's
      department and have leave approval rights)
