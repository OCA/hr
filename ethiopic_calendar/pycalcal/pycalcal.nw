\chapter{Literate Calendrical Calculations}

%\lettrine[lhang=1, nindent=0pt, lines=3]{I}{n}
\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{his}
document describes a \py~\cite{computer:language:python}
implementation of the calendrical algorithms described in
the book \textit{Calendrical Calculations}~\cite{calendar:calcal}.
According to the authors, the book is textit{the companion} text of
the algorithms 
implemented in the \cl\ package \texttt{CC3}.
The source code for \texttt{CC3}, \texttt{calendrica-3.0.cl}, is made
available electronically 
by the publisher, see \cite{calendar:calcal}.

I provide full reference to the original \cl\ and credit (and deep
respect) to its authors, Prof.s~Dershowitz and Reingold.

On the (long) way to complete this project, I experimented with
Scons~\cite{scons}, Test-Driven Development~\cite{tdd} and
web applications~\cite{google:appengine}.

I tackled this task the Literate Programming
way~\cite{literate:lp} using the \nw~tool.~\cite{literate:lps,
noweb:distro}
As such all code and documentation is generated from
a single source file and prefixed with the following warning:

\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
The software is for now a single piece of text (a.k.a. a \py~file):
<<*>>=
<<pycalcal.py>>

@ It is organised as follows:
<<pycalcal.py>>=
<<testa>>
<<global import statements>>

<<time and astronomy>>
<<astronomical lunar calendars>>
<<persian calendar>>
<<bahai calendar>>
<<french revolutionary calendar>>
<<chinese calendar>>
<<modern hindu calendars>>
<<tibetan calendar>>

examples spread in the book~\cite{calendar:calcal}, its Appendix C or
devised by myself.

@ The code for tests execution is:
<<execute tests>>=
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()

@ 
Given I also want to be able to run a single unit tests part in isolation, i.e.
when working on Persian calendar I just want to run the Persian
calendar's tests, I generate a unit tests file per each part.
Here is an example of how the unit tests are templated for an hypotetical
\texttt{xyzzy} calendar/section:
\begin{verbatim}
@<<xyzzyUnitTest.py>>=
# @<<generated code warning>>
@<<import for testing>>
from appendixCUnitTest import AppendixCTable1TestCaseBase
@<<xyzzy unit test>>
@<<execute tests>>
\end{verbatim}

@ The following imports are to be used:

\section{Scaffolding}
\label{sec:scaff}
\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he} accuracy of the algorthms presented require
definition of constants and calculations that span many bits.
I enable true division feature as in PEP~238~\cite{python:PEP238}
in order to smoothly express simple constants as defined in the \cl\ code,
i.e. \texttt{1/360}
<<global import statements>>=
# use true division
from __future__ import division

@
In order to insure the same precision of computations as in \cl\ code
where numbers are postfixed with \texttt{L0}, meaning 50-bit precision,
I use the \texttt{mpmath} library~\cite{math:multiprecision} and set
the precision accordingly\index{floating-point arithmetic}.
<<global import statements>>=
# Precision in bits, for places where CL postfixes numbers with L0, meaning
# at least 50 bits of precision
from mpmath import *
mp.prec = 50

\section{Basics}
\label{sec:basic}
The following are general definitions, algorithms and helper functions
that will be used to perform a lot of the various calculations for the
subsequent calendars.

@
\subsection{Implementation}
Some computations have meaningless results in certain circumstances,
they will return a predefined value, \texttt{BOGUS}, to mark this case.
<<basic code>>=
################################
# basic calendrical algorithms #
################################
# see lines 244-247 in calendrica-3.0.cl
`BOGUS = 'bogus'

@
Some \cl\ functions are available under other names and/or in
additional packages in \py\ or with a different semantic,
so they are aliased or loaded or (re)defined accordingly.
This is the case for \texttt{quotient}, \texttt{floor} and
\texttt{round}, the \cl\ versions return integers while in
\py\ they can return a float if (at least) one of the arguments
is a float.
<<basic code>>=
# see lines 249-252 in calendrica-3.0.cl
# m // n
# The following
#      from operator import floordiv as `quotient
# is not ok, the corresponding CL code
# uses CL 'floor' which always returns an integer
# (the floating point equivalent is 'ffloor'), while
# 'quotient' from operator module (or corresponding //)
# can return a float if at least one of the operands
# is a float...so I redefine it (and 'floor' and 'round' as well: in CL
# they always return an integer.)
def `quotient(m, n):
    """Return the whole part of m/n."""
    from operator import floordiv
    return ifloor(m / n)

@ For \texttt{floor} and \texttt{round} I decided to make it
explicit the fact that they return an integer and named
them with a prefixed \textit{i} (for integer):
<<basic code>>=
# I (re)define floor: in CL it always returns an integer.
# I make it explicit the fact it returns an integer by
# naming it ifloor
def `ifloor(n):
    """Return the whole part of m/n."""
    from math import floor
    return int(floor(n))

# I (re)define round: in CL it always returns an integer.
# I make it explicit the fact it returns an integer by
# naming it iround
def `iround(n):
    """Return the whole part of m/n."""
    from __builtin__ import round
    return int(round(n))


# m % n   (this works as described in book for negative integres)
# It is interesting to note that
#    mod(1.5, 1)
# returns the decimal part of 1.5, so 0.5; given a moment 'm'
#    mod(m, 1)
# returns the time of the day
from operator import `mod

# see lines 254-257 in calendrica-3.0.cl
def `amod(x, y):
    """Return the same as a % b with b instead of 0."""
    return y + (mod(x, -y))

@ The following  definitions are a translation in \py\ of \cl\
macros\index{Macro}. Macro definition is a very powerful tool but
it does not exist in the \py\ language.

The principles of the algorithms described in~\cite{calendar:calcal}
is to quickly get an approximation and then refine it to get
the correct result.
\texttt{next} and \texttt{final} are used in the \textit{refine} phase.

\section{Time and Astronomy}
\label{sec:astro}
The location of an object in the sky is determined by celestial
coordinates, analogous to the latitude and longotude for the location
of a position of Earth.
\subsection{$alt-az$ Coordinate systems}
\label{sec:alt-az}
The alt-az is a topocentric (i.e. as seen from the observer's
place on the Earth's surface) celestial coordinate system.
It uses the horizon as its fundamental circle which divides the sky in
two emispheres. The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the zenith,
while the one of the lower hemisphere is called nadir. These are
defined by the local vertical (using a plumb-line or similar).
The point of origin on the horizon is determined by the intersection
of the vertical circle (i.e. trhough zenith and nadir) passing through
north and south celestial pole.

The azimith (A) is the direction of a celestial object, measured
clockwise around the observer's horizon from south.


\subsection{$HA-dec$ Coordinate systems}
\label{sec:HA-dec}

\subsection{$RA-dec$ Coordinate systems}
\label{sec:RA-dec}
Figure~\ref{fig:RA-DEC}\ displays the celestial sphere and the RA-dec coordinate
system (also named second equtorial).
\begin{figure}[h]
  \rule{\textwidth}{0.005in}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figure-0.pdf}
    \caption{RA-dec coordinate system. $N^*$ is the North pole of the
      ecliptic; $N$ is the North Celestial Pole; $\vernal$ is the first point of
      Aries and the zero-point for this coordinate system. Right Ascension ($RA$
      or $\alpha$) is measured in hours towards East ($E$); declination ($dec$
      or $\delta$) is measured in degrees, positive if north ($N$) of the

Figure~\ref{fig:ecliptic}\ displays ecliptic, lunar orbit (angle is exagerated),
the lunar (ascending) node $\ascnode$\ and the origin \vernal\ (at vernal equinox).
It is intersting to note graphically what is later described algorithmically.

\section{Appendix C test data and unit tests}
\label{sec:testdata}
Prof.~Reingold kindly provided me with an electronic version of Appendix C
test data~\cite[see pag xxx]{calendar:calcal}.
In order to verify the alignment of my implementation in \py\ with the
one of the book, I designed the following tools and tests:
<<trasformLatexDates2Cvs>>=
#/bin/sh
# transform "Calendrical Calculations" Appendix C test data
# from LaTeX table to comma-separated-values

sed -e 's/\$//g' -e 's/\\//g' \
    -e's/[    ][      ]*\&[   ][      ]*/,/g' \
    -e 's/multicolumn{4}{c}{fun{bogus}}/bogus,bogus,bogus,bogus/g'

\section{Test Coverage}
\label{sec:coverage}
I want to understand what I am covering with my tests.
This is have a quantitative evaluation of the amount of lines
of code of my software I am traversing with my tests.
This does not give me any confidence about the correctness
of my code, but at least it says what is lacking a test.

I found a nice, simple tool written in \py,
coverage~\cite{coverage}.
I defined a new target in Makefile to produce an HTML report
<<Makefile: coverage target>>=
.PHONY : coverage
coverage: pycalcaltests.py appendixCUnitTest.py testdata
	coverage -e -x pycalcaltests.py    # -e drop previous
	coverage -b -i -d html pycalcal.py # HTML report for pycalcal.py


@ 
\section{Cross checking}
The following scripts have been used to generate and check the initial
set of function signatures for the project.

\subsection{Generating all function signatures}
The follwing command will generate all \py\ function signatures from \cl\ 
counterparts:
<<extractcc3signatures>>=
# <<generated code warning>>
cat calendrica-3.0.cl | grep -e '^(defun ' | \
sed \
    -e 's/ (/(/g' \
    -e 's/-/_/g' \
    -e 's/).*$/):/g' \
    -e 's/ /, /g' \
    -e 's/(defun,/def/' \
    -e 's/lambda/lam/g' \
    -e 's/\([a-zA-z_][a-zA-Z_]*\)?(/is_\1(/g' \
    -e 's/?//g' | \
    tr -d '\15\32'

@ and here is the one to get the ones from pycalcal.py:
<<extractcalcalsignatures>>=
cat pycalcal.py | grep '^def '

@ 
The idea is to extract all functions defined in {calendrica-3.0.cl}
using {extractcc3signatures} and compare them with the ones
in {pycalcal.py} like:
\begin{verbatim}
prompt> cat calendrica-3.0.cl | extractcc3signatures | sort > allcc3
prompt> cat pycalcal.py | extractcalcalsignatures | sort > allcalcal
prompt> diff allcc3 allcalcal
\end{verbatim}

There is also the need to check all constants, i.e. defconstant. TODO.

\subsection{Checking the function signatures}
<<Makefile: cross checks>>=
.PHONY : missing
missing: extractcc3signatures extractcalcalsignatures
	- cat calendrica-3.0.cl | extractcc3signatures - | sort > /tmp/allcc3
	- cat $(NW_MAIN:.nw=.py) | extractcalcalsignatures - | sort > /tmp/allcalcal
	- diff /tmp/allcc3 /tmp/allcalcal

extractcc3signatures: $(NW_MAIN:.nw=.py)
	notangle -Rextractcc3signatures $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) extractcc3signatures
	-chmod ug+x extractcc3signatures

extractcalcalsignatures: $(NW_MAIN:.nw=.py)
	notangle -Rextractcalcalsignatures $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) extractcalcalsignatures
	-chmod ug+x extractcalcalsignatures

\chapter{Future evolutions}
\label{sec:futureevol}
I would like to define an OO version of these calendrical algorithms.
This can be implemented on top of existing functional implementation, i.e.
GregorianCalendar will have relevant fields like, day, month and year
and methods like isEaster() or so.

Validation of astonomical algorithm could be performed using data
service for astronomical applications as made available by the US Naval
Observatory web services \cite{USNO} or the IMCCE~\cite{imcce}.

I created a google app for pycalcal.
In a diirectory named 'calendrica' I did put \texttt{calendrica.py}
and \texttt{app.yaml}. I also create a 'lib' directory where I copied
the whole \texttt{mpmath} distribution.
You can run in web app in your development environment using
\begin{verbatim}
	dev_appserver.py calendrica/
\end{verbatim}
and browsing it at
\begin{verbatim}
	http://localhost:8080/
\end{verbatim}
Once ready you can deploy it using
\begin{verbatim}
	appcfg.py update calendrica/
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Technicalities}
\label{sec:tech}

By definition of \textit{Calendrical Calculations}'s authors, the only
authoritative document is their \cl\  code.
For this reason I want to keep track of the relevant \cl\ code
when defining my \py\ counterpart and the following sections explain how
I make sure I implement all the algorithms and how I pair \cl\ code and
\py\ code..


@ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Inserting snippets of \cl\ code}
\label{sec:snippet}
I would like to be able to prepend the relevant
snippet of (\py-commented) \cl\ code from \texttt{calendrica-3.0.cl}
to the relevant \py\ counterpart.

I created a sort of pre-processor for \nw: it allows to
write a code chunck reference like \texttt{\snippet} and to obtain
the insertion of a portion of a file. 
Its semantic is: ``Insert the content of file 'file' from line 'x' to
line 'y'\,''. 

The preprocessor is called \texttt{premarkup} and is defined as
follows: 
<<premarkup>>=
#! /bin/awk -f
# <<generated code warning>>
#-*- mode: awk -*-
# substitute chunks of the form 'see lines <x>-<y> in <file>'
# with the contents of file 'file' from line 'x' to line 'y' inclusive
# eventually prefixed

/# see lines [0-9][0-9]*-[0-9][0-9]* in .*$/ {
        # extract x and y
        # (file --> substr($1,3))
        split($4, a, "-")
        # the command 'excerpt 10 20 file'
        # prints the contents of file 'file' from line 10 till 20
        system("excerpt " a[1] " " a[2] " " $6 " | prefix")

        # move to next line
        next}
# match and print all the rest
1

@ 
Note that it uses other two scripts, \texttt{prefix} and
\texttt{excerpt}, to insert and comment out the relevant snippet of code.
<<prefix>>=
#!/bin/sh
# <<generated code warning>>
# -*- mode: shell -*-
scriptname=$0

function usage () {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: ${scriptname} [-p prefix] [prepend]
   -p prefix   define new prefix string (default is '# ')
   -h          displays basic help
Prepend <prepend><prefix> to each line.
EOF
    exit 0
}

pref='# '
while getopts hp: name
do
    case $name in
    p)    pref="$OPTARG";;
    h)    usage;;
    esac
done


shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
if (( $# > 1 ))
then
    return 1
fi 

blanks="$*"

sed -e "s,[^.],${blanks}${pref}&,"

@ And here are the targets for Makefile:
<<Makefile: premarkup>>=
premarkup: prefix excerpt
	notangle -Rpremarkup $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) premarkup
	-chmod ug+x premarkup

<<Makefile: prefix>>=
prefix:
	notangle -Rprefix $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) prefix
	-chmod ug+x prefix

@ 
\texttt{Excerpt}, a simple invokation of \texttt{sed}:
<<excerpt>>=
#!/bin/sh
# <<generated code warning>>

# excerpt b e f
# print contents of file 'f' from line 'b' till 'e'

sed -n $1,$2p $3
#$ this is to fake emacs in nw source

@ 
An example of use of \texttt{premarkup} is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
prompt> premarkup pycalcal.nw | noweave -n -delay - | cpif pycalcal.tex
\end{verbatim}

The target for Makefile is
<<Makefile: excerpt>>=
excerpt:
	notangle -Rexcerpt $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) excerpt
	-chmod ug+x excerpt

@

\section{How to avoid \nw\ from indexing comments: HACK?}
\label{sec:nocomment} 
The problem with \nw\ indexing is that comments are parsed as well and
I do not like to get index entries in \cl\ code.
One possible hack is to create indexing info from a copy of the
\LaTeX\ doc where \cl\ code is blanked out.
So \texttt{blankecerpt} will try to accomplish this:
<<blankexcerpt>>=
#!/bin/sh

# blankexcerpt b e f
# print contents of file 'f' from line 'b' till 'e' and changing
# each char into a blank
#excerpt $1 $2 $3 | sed -e's/./ /g'

# In fact we want e - b + 1 blank lines!!!!
for i in $(seq $1..$2)
do
   echo ""
done

#$ this is to fake emacs in nw source

@ Still I am not sure how to use this\ldots but we probably need
something like:
<<blankpremarkup>>=
#! /bin/awk -f
# substitute chunks of the form '# see lines <x>-<y> in <file>'
# with the contents of file 'file' from line 'x' to line 'y' inclusive
# eventually prefixed

/# see lines [0-9][0-9]*-[0-9][0-9]* in .*$/ {
        # extract x and y
        # (file --> substr($1,3))
        split($4, a, "-")
        # the command 'blankexcerpt 10 20 file'
        # prints the contents of file 'file' from line 10 till 20
        system("blankexcerpt " a[1] " " a[2] " " $6 " | prefix")

        # move to next line
        next}
#$ this is to fake emacs in nw source
# match and print all the rest
1

@ 
The relevant Makefile targets are:
<<Makefile: blankpremarkup>>=
blankpremarkup: prefix blankexcerpt
	notangle -Rblankpremarkup $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) blankpremarkup
	-chmod ug+x blankpremarkup

<<Makefile: blankexcerpt>>=
blankexcerpt:
	notangle -Rblankexcerpt $(NW_MAIN) $(CPIF) blankexcerpt
	-chmod ug+x blankexcerpt

\section{Floating-point nuances}
\label{sec:float}
While investigating the differences from my results and \cl\ ones,
I got a nice email exchange with Prof.~Reingold.
I was pointing out that \cl\ on my machine was not returning
the same numbers as in the Appendix C' last table.
He ran it on SPARC and on Intel x86 \ldots and bang!

On the \py\ side, my tests fail for ``Dawn in Paris'' if I
force 6 digits of precision, otherwise they all pass but one
(on RD 601716) when 4 digits are taken: this last paragraph is not true.
I found this was due to the wrong implementation of angle:
division was with integers and not floating point numbers!

\section{Chasing bugs}

Observational Hebrew convertion tests fail for (almost all) Appendix C dates.
I try to find what's wrong in observational\_hebrew\_from\_fixed:
gregorian\_year\_from\_fixed seems to be ok;
observational\_hebrew\_new\_year is not;
gregorian\_new\_year is ok.
\begin{verbatim}
