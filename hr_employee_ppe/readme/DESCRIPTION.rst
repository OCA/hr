This module allows you to manage allocation of PPE to your employees.
A product can be marked as ppe and additional information as duration and indications can also be added.
If ppe products are selected in a equipment request, a button to print a receipt of PPE will appear.
In addition, a chron will check every day if an allocation has been expired.
