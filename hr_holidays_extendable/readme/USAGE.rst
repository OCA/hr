The first thing to do is select which holiday types can be extended.
To do so go the configuration menu in the Leaves app, and select the check
box *Extendable*.

Holidays can only be extended by the Human Resources Manager and when they are
in *Approved* state. A new button will appear automatically when all these
conditions are met.

Clicking on it will open a small wizard that will allow you to select the new
end date for the holiday. After clicking *Extend* the original holiday will be
updated with the new values.
