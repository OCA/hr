First, products which can be requested by employees should be marked as employee personal equipment.
1. Go to *Products* (In *Inventory* App for example).
2. Select a product.
3. Mark the *Is Employee Personal Equipment* flag.(An additional page appears which serves as a hook if additional fields are needed).

To create a personal equipment request, a common user should follow the next steps:
1. Go to menu *Employees -> Personal Equipment-> Employee Personal Equipment Request*
2. Current employee is set as default. (An Hr Officer can change the employee if needed).
3. At *Personal Equipment* select the equipments you want to request.
4. Add "Observations" at *Observations* if desired.

Then, an HR Manager should:
1. If everything is correct, "Accept" the request.
2. Finally, when the equipment is given to the employee, the allocation should be validated. This can be done in two ways:
a) Click the allocation in the equipment request that you want to validate, the form view will be opened, and click "Validate".
b) Go to *Employees -> Personal Equipment-> Allocations*. Select the corresponding allocation and click "Validate".

A common user can only see its own allocations. The HR Officer can see all of them.

If needed, the allocation can be expired clicking the button "Expire", which can be found at the allocation form view.
