HR Payroll Account Date
=======================

Adds a move date to the payslip.
Allows the user to propose/force a specific move date.
If none is proposed, the field will be completed with the actual move date.


Usage
=====

Create a payslip
----------------
Go to: Human Resources -> Payroll -> Employee Payslip

- Complete the payslip details
- Go to 'Other information', 'Accounting' section and complete the field
'Force move date'.


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

By default the Salary Journal should be set up with the field 'Check Date in
 Period' unflagged. Otherwise the application will raise an error message if
  the user enters a move date corresponding to a past period.
