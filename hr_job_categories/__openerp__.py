Attach Categories (Tags) to Employees Based on Job Position
===========================================================

This module is useful for tagging employees based on their job positions.
For example, all Supervisors could be attached to the Supervisors category.
Define which categories a job belongs to in the configuration for the job.
When an employee is assigned a particular job the categories attached to that
job will be attached to the employee record as well.
