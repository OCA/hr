For employees:

* when an calendar event makes the luncheon voucher distribution cancelled (Off-site or free lunch for instance), add the corresponding category to the event.
* fill as usual the days off

For HR manager:

* For each distribution period, he should:

  #. go in *Employees* tree view
  #. select all the employees concerned by luncheon vouchers distribution
  #. click on header button *Generate luncheon vouchers allocation*
  #. fill the wizard form and validate => a voucher allocation request is created for each employee
  #. confirm an allocation request when the figures are confirmed
  #. mark the requests as "Distributed" when the vouchers has been effectively distributed

  * the employee worked on one or all the attendances of the day (depending if option *Half working days cancel luncheon vouchers* is True or not)
  * there is no meeting which cancel the voucher during that day (*Site off* or *Free lunch* meeting for instance)

* an attendance is considered as worked as long as there is no leave on the whole attendance time slot
