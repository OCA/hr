Contract Multi Jobs
===================
In some companies, one employee may have more than one job position
assigned to the same contract.

An example is a construction worker who makes different types of jobs
for the same company like bricklaying, electricity, carpentry.

Also in restaurants, a waiter can also work as a barman.

This module enables multiple job positions for one contract.
