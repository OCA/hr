This module allows you to define expense products that requires a receipt to
be submitted.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Go to Expenses > Configuration > Expense Products
* Create or select a product
* Check the box "Require a receipt"

Some users may be able to ignore the attachment requirements.
This may be useful where a single document may need to be split into several different expense lines.
The users allowed this must be added to the "Expenses-can skip required attachment" security group.

Usage
=====

* Create an Expense Report containing a product configured to require attachment
* Try to submit the Expense Report without an attachment
* Unless user is member of the "Can skip required attachments" group,
  a validation error will prevent submitting the Expense Report
* Upload a file attachment on the expense line and re-submit
