This module is a fork:
 * We fork module https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/odoo_payroll/tree/9.0/payroll_amount_ytd
 * We upgrade it to Odoo 10.0
 * We remove all dependencies and make it usable with Odoo core module hr_payroll
 * This module sums up the field total while the forked module sums up the field amount
