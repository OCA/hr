It's assumed that for each expense sheet, the *payments* that are reconciled
with their *journal entry* were created and reconciled by the *Expense Tracker*
module automatically. Therefore, when this module is installed, these payments
will automatically be associated with said expense sheet so that they can be
deleted in case the expense sheet is canceled.
