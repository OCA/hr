Contract Hourly Rate
====================
The objective of this module is to manage employee hourly rates. Annual wage
is still possible. On the contract, the field salary_computation_method allows
to choose between hourly rate and annual wage.

Each contract job belongs to an hourly rate class if the employee is paid
by hourly rates. This allows to manage hourly rate increments over the years
for multiple employees at the same time.
