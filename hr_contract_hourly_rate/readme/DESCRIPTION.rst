This module was written to extend the functionality of employees contracts
to support hourly rates between dates in calculation of the wage.

Note: This module also modifies options in selection of wage calculation,
"wage" to "yearly",
"hourly_rate" to "hourly",
and adds "monthly" option. Modules that are dependants of this module should
take in consideration this change when calculating the wage.
