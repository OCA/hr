On the employee form view you will have 2 fields, one for Corporate Mobile's PIN,
and a second one for Corporate Mobile's PUK. Both fields are optional.
PIN field will only accept 4 digit numbers, meanwhile PUK will only accept 8 digit
numbers.
Users in the 'Officer : Manage all employees' group or a group with higher privileges
must belong to the 'Change PIN/PUK' group to be able to view and edit the employee's
PIN/PUK.
Users who are not in at least the 'Officer : Manage all employees' group must be in
the 'View PIN/PUK' group to view their own PIN and PUK on their employee record.
