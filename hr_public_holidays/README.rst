==================
HR Public Holidays
==================

This module allows to define public holidays at country or state level by year.

These holidays will be taken into account in standard resource allocation and
requests, and can be used by other modules as base data.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Leaves > Public Holidays > Public Holidays*.
#. Create a record, specifying:

   * Year for the holidays you are going to set.
   * Optionally, a country where the holidays apply. If not set, it means
     holidays are global.
#. On "Public Holidays" section, introduce a line for each of the holidays
   you want to specify.
#. Optionally, you can set at line level several countries for limiting the
   holidays to that countries.

On following years, you can speed up public holidays creation using a wizard:

#. Go to *Leaves > Public Holidays > Create Next Year Public Holidays*.
#. If there's no special situation, you only need to click on "Create" for
   applying the same holidays as this year for the next.
#. If you need to generate holidays for another year different from next one,
   or take as source another year different from the last one, go to the
   "Optional" page for configuring these parameters.
