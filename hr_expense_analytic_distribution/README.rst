==============================
Use analytic plans in expenses
==============================

This module allows you to assign analytic distribution to expense lines
instead of analytic accounts. This way, you can distribute the costs of an
expense over multiple analytic accounts.

Usage
=====

Create an analytic distribution and set this distribution on an expense.
Process expense as always and analytic distribution will be propagated to move
lines of expense.
