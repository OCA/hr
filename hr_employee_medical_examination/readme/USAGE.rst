This module adds a wizard to generate medical examinations for employees and an
action to see them.

The idea is to generate all the examinations using the wizard and then manage them
individually even though the usage of the wizard is not mandatory.

For generating the medical examinations:

#. Go to the menu *Employees > Medical Examinations > Generate Medical Examinations*.
#. Select a name and the employees and generate it.

To see all the medical examinations:

#. Go to the menu *Employees > Medical Examinations > View Medical Examinations*.
