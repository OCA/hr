Adds the concept of period in the human resources management.

The objective of the module is to create periods of time to
be used in the human resources management flows such as
specific payroll period of time or timesheet periods.

Regarding to payrolls, it adds the date of payment on the
payslip and payslip batch. This date is automatically filled
when selecting a period. It also adds a sequence on the payslip
batch name and the company on the payslip batch.

Installation
============

Install the payroll of your localization, then install this module.

Configuration
=============

Create a fiscal year
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to: Payroll -> Configuration -> Payroll Fiscal Year

 - Select a type of schedule, e.g. monthly
 - Select a duration, e.g. from 2015-01-01 to 2015-12-31
 - Select when the payment is done, e.g. the second day of the next period
 - Click on create periods, then confirm

The first period of the year is now open and ready to be used.

Some companies have employees paid at different types of schedule.
In that case, you need to create as many fiscal years as types of schedule
required. The same applies in a multi-company configuration.

Usage
=====

Create a payslip batch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to: Human Resources -> Payroll -> Payslip Batches

The first period of the fiscal year is already selected.
You may change it if you manage multiple types of schedules.

 - Click on Generate Payslips

The employees paid with the selected schedule are automatically selected.

 - Click on Generate

 - Confirm your payslips

 - Click on Close

The payroll period is closed automatically and the next one is open.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

#. Currently it is not possible to close the HR fiscal year before the end of
   the end of the last period. When implementing this feature, contracts and
   opened payslips should be updated with the new period assigned.
#. It is not possible to use the date_range module in server tools to generate
   semi-monthly periods so those periods are generated as in previous versions.
#. The date_range module does not allow to create a period for just one day.
