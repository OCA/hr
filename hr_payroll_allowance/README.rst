HR Payroll Allowances
=====================

Adds the concept of payroll allowances
The aim of this addon is to take away the complexity associated with setting
up salary rules and editing service structures to reflect allowances being paid
to employees.
Also from experience a lot of companies in West Africa (may also apply to other
regions) do not have standardized pay structures with employees in the same job
having different allowances.


Installation
============

Install as usual from the module installation screen


Configuration
=============

* Go to Human Resources > Configuration > Salary Allowance Category and create the allowance categories applicable to you company

salary structure on creating an allowance
