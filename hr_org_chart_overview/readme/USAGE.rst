To use the module go to Employees > Reporting > Organizational Chart.

The chart can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the arrows that appear
when the mouse is over a node (employee). Furthermore, clicking on an employee
will redirect the user to the form view of that employee.

Using the search bar, the user can filter the chart by entering the employee
name or department. To clear the filter, delete all introduced characters.
