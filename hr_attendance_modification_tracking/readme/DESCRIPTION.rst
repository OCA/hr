Attendance changes will now be registered in the chatter.
This will help prevent cheating in check-in or check-out time.
List and form views also include this change information.
Use cases:
1) Attendances created from kiosk or check-in/check-out screens, are created as automatic.
If their check-in or check-out dates are modified by any user, attendances are checked as
'Manually changed'.
2) Attendances created from form view will apply a 60 seconds tolerance between entered and real times.
If this tolerance is surpassed, attendances are checked as 'Manually changed'.
