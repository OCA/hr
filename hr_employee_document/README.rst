This module displays a button on the employee's profile to view linked attachments, both
for HR officers/managers and the own employee, so you can use it as employee document storage.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module adds read permission to the employee model; the rest of the model data will
be available to the employee.
If another module grants permissions to the employee model (Pre-officer for example),
I will need to create a rule to extend the basic permissions.
