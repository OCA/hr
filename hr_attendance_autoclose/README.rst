This module close stale attendances automatically. Without this module, when
an employee forgets to check out at the end on the day and the next day the
employee does not realize of that, then the error is propagated and all the
attendances are wrong. With this module only the attendance with the issue is
wrong, and the manager knows the system closes the attendance, not the employee
