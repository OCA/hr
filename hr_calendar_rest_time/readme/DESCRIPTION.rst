This module allows to add rest time to the resource calendar, to be considered
during the computation of worked hours.

For example, monday employees start at 9AM and leave at 6PM, with a rest time
of 1 hour. Therefore the time worked is 8 hours.

The correct working hours will then be correctly considered in various
existing hr reports.
