Employee Benefit Percent
========================
Add employee benefits based on a percent of the gross salary


Configuration
=============

When setting your employee benefits, you may select the type 'Percent of Gross Salary'.
If you write 2.5 in the employee/employer amount field, this means 2.5 % of the gross salary.

If you use this feature, you must ensure that the field gross_salary on the payslip is filled
before the employee benefits are computed.

For this, you may add the following code in the proper salary rule:

payslip.set_gross_salary(GROSS)

where 'GROSS' is the code of the salary rule that defines the gross salary.
