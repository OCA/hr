Computes the actual days for which employee will be on leave taking into
account:

* Other leaves in the same interval.
* Rest days (if configured in that way).
* Public holidays (if configured in that way).

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Leaves > Configuration*
#. For each leave type, you can mark:

   * **Exclude Rest Days**: If you want to remove for the total number of days
     those which are not workable.
   * **Exclude Public Holidays**: For substracting of the total number of days
     those which are public holidays that are global, for your country or for
     your state.
   * **Compute Full Days**: It will compute days in the interval as full,
     independently from the starting/ending time.

   See `hr_public_holidays` module README for more information on how to
   configure these public holidays.
#. For being able to manually change number of days, you have to be
   *Leave / Manager*. If not, the field will be read only.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Leaves > Dashboard*.
#. Select dragging on the calendar the days you want to be on leave, or go
   to the form view for selecting start and end dates.
#. On this form, you have 2 new checks for selecting full days instead of
   days with time. If you deselect one of these checks, you will be able to
   select also the starting/ending time of the leave.
#. Select the proper "Leave Type".
#. The number of days will be computed and shown according options on
   leave type. If no leave type yet specified, then default configuration is
   to exclude both rest days and public holidays.
