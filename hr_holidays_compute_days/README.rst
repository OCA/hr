It extends the computation of the number of days in leaves with:

* Possibility of including rest days (if configured in that way).
* Force full days (if configured in that way).

It also eases the manual entry of the leave, including a date selection
instead of date and time.

Finally, it limits the possibility to manually change number of days if you
are not leave manager.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Leaves > Configuration*
#. For each leave type, you can mark:

   * **Exclude Rest Days**: If you want to remove for the total number of days
     those which are not workable.
   * **Compute Full Days**: It will compute days in the interval as full,
     independently from the starting/ending time.

#. For being able to manually change number of days, you have to be
   *Leave / Manager*. If not, the field will be read only.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Leaves > Dashboard*.
#. Select dragging on the calendar the days you want to be on leave, or go
   to the form view for selecting start and end dates.
#. On this form, you have 2 new checks for selecting full days instead of
   days with time. If you deselect one of these checks, you will be able to
   select also the starting/ending time of the leave.
#. Select the proper "Leave Type".
#. The number of days will be computed and shown according options on leave
   type.
#. If no leave type yet specified, then default configuration is to exclude
   rest days.
