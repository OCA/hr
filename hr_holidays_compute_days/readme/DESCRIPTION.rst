It extends the computation of the number of days in leaves with:

* Possibility of including rest days (if configured in that way).
* Force full days (if configured in that way).

It also eases the manual entry of the leave, including a date selection
instead of date and time.

Finally, it limits the possibility to manually change number of days if you
are not leave manager.
