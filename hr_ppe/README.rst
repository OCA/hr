===================================
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
===================================

For some job positions it is required the use of personal protective equipment
whit this module you can configure a list of products that the company will
provide to the employee.

In order to make it easier there is a check to configure if a product is or
not selectable in the PPE list. You can configure the list in a job title,
so when an employee has it assigned, with just pushing a button it will
create a picking list (of picking type PPE). When the picking is transferred
the product will be visible in a list, in order to know which products have
already been given to the employee and when.
